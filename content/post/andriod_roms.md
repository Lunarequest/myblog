Andriod has for many years been everyone's go to in the budget space, but for my Andriod has held a special place in my heart becuase of "roms". A rom is what your phone boots up, it contains everything from the linux kernel to the usepace stuff like the ui or preinstalled apps

If you have poked around under the hood you would know andriod is opensource and everyone can use "ASOP" or the andriod open source project, the folks over the XDA forum really put this to the test, they build custom roms, extend lifetimes and even run pure linux on phones that are often thrown to the side by manufactures.

My Redmi note 9 pro(Curtana) is one phone that managed to gain a almost cult like developer group, one dev is even working on getting it to boot mobian or mobile debian. With this phone I got really started to understand the workings of andriod, and why modding is actually a bit dangrouse.

Modding a phone can be very easy or basically impossible. For example my old phone the Honor 10 lite is bassicaly impossible to rom. It's impossible to unlock its bootloader since the Huawie the company that made it stopped offer bootloader unlocks. Conversly the Pixel line of phones is the "holy grail" with the ability to "relock" the bootloder with custom keys the secuitry is just unparelled.

## The good

In my experince using a rom can be a breath of fresh air, MiUI can be really annoying with its overload of ads and cluncky interface promoting the honestly very shady feeling "alternative" appstore. The first rom I tried project sakura changed everything, while it was very buggy it felt diffrent it felt good. I don't regret it. 

## The bad
