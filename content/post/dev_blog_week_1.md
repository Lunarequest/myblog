I recently joined the fivnex a open source dev group founded by Kia a freind of mine. Currently the fivnex group is working on ArisbluBSD. A BSD distrobtion aimed to make a live-cd that is powerful and user freindly while being customizble. another project under fivnex was arisred linux a sister distro to BSD that hasn't been started yet. So when I proposed moving raspbain TV to the  fivnex group Kia recomeneded I take the arisred name. Thus arisred TV was born.
