Most people know me as null. I am a 17 renegade programer in love with linux. I have no allegiances. If you need help with one of my tutorials feel free to contact me. I am always up to fix problems. I hope you enjoy your stay at my blog. also all hail linux. btw I use arch(if got the meme +10 internet points). If you want to know where I got my profile pic. It was by KamidoRei(super greatful for the free art) you can check her [devient art](https://www.deviantart.com/kamidorei)  or her website when her website is up yet (i'll update when it is)
