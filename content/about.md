Most people know me as null. I am an 18 year old programer in love with linux. Over the past few years I picked up a variety of skill including google-fu and a knack of containerizing applications. I am currently run Fedora  on my systems. I like working on projects. Feel free to reach out to me through my [contact form](/contact/)


If you want to know where I got my profile pic. It was by KamidoRei(super greatful for the free art) you can check her [devient art](https://www.deviantart.com/kamidorei).
