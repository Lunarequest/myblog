Most people know me as null. I am a 17 renegade programer in love with linux. Over the past few years I picked up a varity of skill inlcuding google-fu and a knack of Dockerising applications. I currently run Fedora and Arch linux on my systems. I like working on programs. Feel free to reach out to me through my [email](advaith.madhukar@gmail.com)


If you want to know where I got my profile pic. It was by KamidoRei(super greatful for the free art) you can check her [devient art](https://www.deviantart.com/kamidorei)  or her website when her website is up yet (i'll update when it is)
