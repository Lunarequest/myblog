This is going to be my first long term porject and series. I will be posting around once a month with updates and changes I will be implementing.</description></item><item><title>Arch install automation</title><link>https://nullrequest.com/post/arch_automation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:12:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nullrequest.com/post/arch_automation/</guid><description>background I have a OEM desktop that I use as a headless(without a display) server. I found that I nuke this server very often when I mess something up and have to reinstall. With my recent move switching to Arch as my primary operating system. Reinstalling became a hassel.

I am assuming you have used linux this does not and will not replace the arch wiki.</description></item><item><title>How to setup Dockerised darkweb website</title><link>https://nullrequest.com/post/darkweb_website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 12:59:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nullrequest.com/post/darkweb_website/</guid><description>Discalmer I am not resposbile if you break something.

Background Before I get into how to set everything up. I am going to give some background on why I created this guide. Around 3 months ago a discord server I was on wanted to try and create an ultra secure Internet Relay Chat (IRC for short) server.</description></item></channel></rss>
