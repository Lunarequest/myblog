Bye the time you read this i will most likly be dead. They&rsquo;ll say it was sucide and it is. life is a rigged game. I am sick of always losing. I am sick of being useless. I have been living a lie for most of my life my parents have put me down for the last time. over the past year i met some people who really changed me for the better. I&rsquo;d like to say sorry to them again, I know what i will do is selfish but this is me say &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; to the world. my last act. I am going to be saying some stuff for to the people who i care about.</p><h2 id=to-reid>To reid</h2><p>you were my brother in arms. you helped me go through so much. i am sorry i won&rsquo;t be there for you when you need it. you need to keep talking to neko.
